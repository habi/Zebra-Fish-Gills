Complete analysis for the manuscript on the *Adaptation Mechanism Of The Adult Zebrafish Respiratory Organ To Endurance Training*.
A preprint of the manuscript can be found on bioRxiv with the DOI [10.1101/744300](https://doi.org/10.1101/744300).

We want to see differences in the gills of trained and untrained zebrafishes.
The [analysis notebook](https://github.com/habi/Zebra-Fish-Gills/blob/master/Gills-Analysis.ipynb) was used to read all the raw data and to procuce all figures in the manuscript.

The tomographic datasets of the delineated fish gills which we used for the analyis can be downloaded on [OSF](https://cos.io/our-products/osf/) here: https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/A5ESX
This should enable you to get exactly the same results as we did, e.g. do some [reproducible research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility#Reproducible_research).
Please get in touch with me if you cannot repeat the analysis with this data, I'm happy to help!
You can either send me an [email](https://www.anatomie.unibe.ch/haberthu), [file an issue](https://github.com/habi/Zebra-Fish-Gills/issues) or use the 'chat on Gitter' badge on top to start a chat.
